 WARNING: Please note that the contracts contained within this repository have not been audited and as such may not be feasible 
    to deploy to the mainnet as-is. The contracts act only as an example of how to develop
    smart contracts in Solidity. They may contain vulnerabilities that are unaccounted for and
    should not be used in a production environment. Do your own diligence before deploying any smart contract
    to the blockchain because once deployed, the contract can not be modified.
